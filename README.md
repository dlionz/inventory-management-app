#Inventory Management Application

This is an Inventory Management Application that utilizes Node.js and mySql to update and retrieve information based on user inputs.

Currently, the app Displays all available inventory to the user. Then the user is prompted to chose and item they would like to purchase, and how much of that item the user wants. Once these inputs are received the tables are updated accordingly and then re-displayed for the user as well as users cost is displayed.
